                    <h1>What is Basketball?</h1>
                    <p>Basketball is a physical sport played between 2 teams of 5 players (+ substitute players) each
                        on a retangular court. Each team scores by tossing the ball through the opponent's goal, which is a hoop
                        that is usually 10 feet high with a rectangular board against it. The players have 4 quarters (usually 10 minutes each)
                        to score as many points as possible. The team with the most points by the end of the game wins.

                        On the winter of 1891, Dr. James Naismith who was a Canadian-American physical educator, wanted to come up with a new
                        indoor athletic activity to occupy his physical education class during the cold winter. He spent 2 weeks doing so in
                        his office
