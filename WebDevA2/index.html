                <h1>What is Basketball?</h1>
                <p>Basketball is a physical sport played between 2 teams of 5 players (+ substitute players) each
                    on a retangular court. Each team scores by tossing the ball through the opponent's goal, which
                    is a hoop
                    that is usually 10 feet high with a rectangular board against it. The players have 4 quarters
                    (usually 10 minutes each)
                    to score as many points as possible. The team with the most points by the end of the game wins.

                <br>
                <h2>Where it all began</h2>
                <p>
                    On the winter of 1891, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Naismith" target="_blank">Dr.
                        James Naismith</a>
                    who was a Canadian-American physical educator for Springfield College in Massachusetts,
                    wanted to come up with a new indoor athletic activity to occupy his physical education class
                    during the cold winter.
                    He spent 2 weeks doing so in his office. He first started with a combination of other popular
                    sports at that time such as
                    rugby, soccer and lacrosse, however, they often led to his students getting injured.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He then went to find two peach baskets and nailed them to a railing of the gymnasium balcony,
                    one at each end, which so
                    happened to be 10 feet tall. Since the peach baskets did not have holes at the bottom at that
                    time, someone had to stand at
                    the top of the balcony to retrieve the ball every time it gets shot into the basket. With some
                    basic rules implemented, the
                    first game of basketball was played. Decades later, it is now a worldwide sport.

                            Violations are rules implemented to turn the possession over.
                            There are many violations in the game of basketball, but here are the more common one
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h2>Time Violation</h2>
                            Offensive players are given 24 seconds, known as a shot clock, to score the ball. This shot clock
                            only starts counting down after the offensive team gains possession. If the time runs out before
                            the offesinve team attempts to score a basket, the possession flips.
                            <br>

                                These violations are given out if a player comes into contact with another in a physical manner.
                                The person who gets fouled may also receive a free throw.

                            The point guard, also known as the "One" position, is the typically the player with the best ball handling skills
                             and passer. They are usually also the fastest and good a driving in the basket.
                             They are in charge of handling the ball and calling plays during the game.

                            The shooting guards, also known as the "Two" position, are players who are the best shooters in the team. Their main

                            Small forwards, or the "Three" position, are like shooting guards but more versatile. They are usually the most athletic in the team
                            who can score from a range and also in the paint.

                            Power forwards, or the "Four" position, play a big part for both offense and defense as they have to help make plays for the point

                            Centers, or the "Five" position, are usually the biggest player in the team. Just like power forwards, their job is to grab rebounds
                            and defend the under basket.

                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks" target="_blank">Milwaukee Bucks</a> and
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers" target="_blank">Los Angelos Lakers</a>. He played as a Center
                        who dominated in his time. As a 7 foot tall player, it was almost impossible to stop him from scoring in the paint. His
                        unstoppable signature shot, the "Skyhook", helped him score a total of 38,387 points, the most in the NBA before recently
                        broken by Lebron James. Additionally, he has won 6 NBA championships.
